### Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website is designed using a combination of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Bootstrap. I have currently completed the Dr Angela Yu HTML & CSS section of her Udemy Course. 

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

CSS Grid & Flexbox for responsive layout

Bootstrap for initial structure and styling

## Reflections

Using Bootstrap was helpful in the early stages of development, allowing for quick structuring and styling. However, as the project progressed, making custom changes became more challenging and sometimes felt restrictive. This led me to rely more on CSS Grid and Flexbox for better control over the design and layout. I think I will also stick to CSS grid and Flexbox throughout my future designs. 

## Features

Fully responsive design

Clean and modern UI

Sections for about me, projects, and contact information

## Future Improvements

Further refinements to the styling and responsiveness

Potential integration of additional animations and interactive elements
